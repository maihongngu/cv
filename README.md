<i><q>Your time is limited, don’t WASTE it living someone else’s life. Don’t be trapped by dog-ma, which is living the result of OTHER people’s thinking. Don’t let the noise of other opinions drown your own inner voice. And most important, have the courage to follow your heart and intuition, they somehow already know what you truly want to become. Everything else is secondary.</q></i>
